## Need of portfolio for a developer ‚òùÔ∏è

- Professional way to showcase your work
- Increases your visibility and online presence
- Shows you‚Äôre more than just a resume

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/nandkk05/dev-portfolio

# Go into the repository
$ cd dev-portfolio

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the local development server
$ npm start

# Build for production
$ npm run build
```

## Template Instructions:

### Step 1 - STRUCTURE

Go to `/src/data/userData.js` and fill your information, there are serveral sections:

### Blog Section

- Add your [dev.to](https://dev.to) username if you want to show blogs section

### Projects Section

- This is a object with following structure, here you can edit information accordingly 
  ```
  {
    name: "Master app",
    desc: "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.",
    techStack: "React js, Firebase, Cloud Functions",
    githubLink: "https://github.com/****",

  },
  ```

  ## Deployment üì¶

Once you have done with your setup. You need to put your website online!

I recommend to use [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to achieve this on the EASIEST WAY

You could also host directly with Netlify by linking your own repository.
